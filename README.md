# Contributions

* Jeffery Brown: Designed and implemented all code for this application.

* Data:
    * The list projects, descriptions, technologies used, and key links was manually populated in `static/js/portfolio_info.js`

# Summary

* The goal for this page is to provide users with a simple summary of key projects I have completed, technologies used, and a hint of approaches I took.
* To make ongoing maintenance of this site easier, I used JavaScript code to build the  Projects table based upon information in the `portfolio_info.js` file.  The terms in the Technologies Used list are collected as the Project table is being built, and a Set is used to ensure that the Technologies Used entries are unique.
* Each Project listed on the page has been updated with a helpful `README.md` file, including where appropriate screenshots, Jupyter notebook snippets, or other helpful content.

Enjoy!
